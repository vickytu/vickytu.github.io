<p>Hello there! I am a senior at Yale University pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science. As Director of Sponsorship of the Yale Undergraduate Student Hacker Organization, I reach out to companies to partner with Pawprint, a day-long 200-high schooler hackathon, and Y-Hack, a 36-hour hackathon with over 1000 hackers. This summer I work as a Cloud Administrator Intern for the Yale CS Cloud Project.<br></p>

<p>I enjoy spending my free time with other members of UCW, my Christian fellowship, and expanding my skill set (i.e. baking, programming, etc).</p>
